How to reduce fractions:

Loop

    Divide both numerator and denominator by n, which starts at 2 and increases by one each loop iteration.

    If the remainder is 0 for both, set numerator and denominator to new divided values.

    Stop when n becomes larger than either the numerator or denominator.

    Run this loop over and over until n becomes larager than the numerator or denominator.

Endloop

Code:

for (int i = 2; i <= m_numerator || i <= m_denominator; i++) {

    int n_remainder = m_numerator % i;
    int d_remainder = m_denominator % i;

    if (n_remainder == 0 && d_remainder == 0) {

        m_numerator = m_numerator / i;
        m_denominator = m_denominator / i;
        break;

    }

}

Updated Code:

bool fully_reduced = false;

while (!fully_reduced) {

    for (int i = 2; i <= m_numerator || i <= m_denominator; i++) {

        int n_remainder = m_numerator % i;
        int d_remainder = m_denominator % i;

        if (n_remainder == 0 && d_remainder == 0) {

            m_numerator = m_numerator / i;
            m_denominator = m_denominator / i;
            break;

        }

        if (i == m_numerator || i == m_denominator) {

            fully_reduced = true;
            break;

        }

    }

}

Main program flow:

1. Ask for initial numerator and denominator.
2. Enter loop
    1. Select operation
    2. Perform operation

Illegal input?
- denominator cannot be 0
- check for floats? It might be fine if they're just truncated.
- Numerator and denominator can be negative.
    - Whenever reduce_fraction function is called, it should also check for negatives.
    - If both numerator and denominator are negative, it should turn them both positive.
    - If just numerator is negative, leave it how it is.
    - If denominator is negative, make that positive and make the numerator negative.


How to add fractions:

1. Multiply numerator 1 and denominator 1 by denominator 2
2. Multiply nunmerator 2 and denominator 2 by denominator 1
3. Add numerators
4. Reduce

How to check if a number given as input is a float:

1. Get float number from keyboard
2. Make a copy of that number.
3. Cast the copy to an int and back to a float, cutting off all the digits after the decimal
4. Compare the copy to the original. If they're equal, the number inputted was an int.
If not, it was a float
